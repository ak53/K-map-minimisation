# K-map-minimisation
Implemented K-map minimisation using python
the function takes in the number of variables as first argument and minterm values as secong argument.Example-
minFunc(4,"(0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,12,13,14)d-"),here 4 is the number of variables and 0 signifies 0000=X'Y'Z'W',1=0001=XYZ'W
For the above example,the function outputs "W'Z'+XZ'+Y'"

ISSUE: Sometimes does not display the best answer in cases when multiple answers are possible
